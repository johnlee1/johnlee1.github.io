					John: So I'm with Mr. Addison Horner. <br><br>

					<b>Addison: Hello. </b><br><br>


					John: He's very great. And I have a few questions for you.<br><br>

					<b>Addison: Alright. </b><br><br>


					John: Could you please state your full name? <br><br>

					<b>Addison: My name is Addison Lee Horner.</b><br><br>


					John: That's a good middle name. <br><br>

					<b>Addison: Thank you, I like it.</b><br><br>

					(John chuckles.) <br><br>

					<b>Addison: It's very nice.</b><br><br>

					John: Alright. What did you do for TWR this summer?<br><br>

					<b>Addison: I have been working in the SIP deparmtent. I have been doing music composition, creating a lot of music beds, transitions, and themes for use in different radio programs across the world for TWR. </b><br><br>


					John: Mhmm. And how has God been working in your life this summer? <br><br>

					<b>Addison: In so many ways he has been working in me for sure. Workwise, he has been helping me figure out the purpose of what I am doing. The purpose of why I am making music, the motivation behind what I do, and really where my desires lie behind music. Like if I'm making music just for me, then it's really purposeless in the end because I'm going to be dead and gone and it doesn't matter. But if I'm making music for God it serves a purpose. It helps spread God's love and spread God's message across the world, it helps facilites that. And it's part of that message which is really the best purpose I could ask for. And then personally, somewhat similar, God has been showing me one of the biggest lessons he's taught is that it's not about me. Everything I'm doing, my work, my social life, my personal life, the struggles I face, the sins I deal with, the successes I have, my opinions of myself, other people's opinions of me, none of that matters as much as God's glory, God's love, and God's plan. So this summer I've been working a lot about how to submit everything about me, everything I want, my plans, my desires, my dreams, my hopes, all of that and submit it to God. It's difficult but it's been very rewarding. </b><br><br>


					John: Yea. Cool. And what do you feel like you've gained? <br><br>

					<b>Addison: A girlfriend. </b><br><br>

					(John laughs.) <br><br>


					<b>Addison: Seriously I feel like, besides that, probably the number one thing I've gained this summer is an appreciation for what missions work looks like in a modern context. When I was younger I considered being a missionary, I thought it would be cool, but I was like 'I don't know, maybe not, I'm a musician what could I do?'. And this summer I've already been able to see how my music has been helping with TWR's mission of spreading the gospel. So being a part of that and seeing the global context of what TWR is doing and even more widely what christians around the world are doing to spread the gospel to unreached peopls has been huge and I've gained a huge appreciation for that and more of a desire to be involved that either as somebody who goes or who sends. For sure. </b><br><br>


					John: Cool. Could you describe your favorite memory from this summer?<br><br>

					<b>Addison: Oh gosh. There are so many. So many I could choose from. I would say there are a lot but the one I'm going to choose is - I was sitting in Scott Hollinger's office talking about a theme I wrote for an African farming program that we're working on. And he's telling me how the people in Africa heard my theme, they liked it, and they wanted to use it for their program. That was probably the first moment where it hit me that what I'm doing is a part of God's work. This is beyond me. This is much bigger than me, much bigger than I could ever dream of. It's about what God is accomplishing around the world. And through the music I make I can be some small part of that. So that was a moment when the big thing hit me of what God is doing in my life and what is God doing around the world for his glory. And so I say that definitely ranks up there among my favorite memory. </b><br><br>


					(Short pause.) <br><br>

					<b>Addison: BLULUBLUBLUBLU. </b><br><br>

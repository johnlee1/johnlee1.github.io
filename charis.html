					Addison: Hello this is Dateline: To Catch a Predator.<br><br>

					<b>Charis: To Catch a Predator?</b><br><br>

					Addison: I'm here with Charis Middleton.<br><br>

					<b>Charis: That's me!</b><br><br>

					Addison: Interviewing her about life and about TWR. So tell me Charis, how has God been working in your life this summer?<br><br>

					<b>Charis: Well, God has been working in my life in tangible and not tangible ways. I think the biggest three areas he has been working in me has been teaching me a lot about what he has equipped me to do for his kingdom in work-based things and just understanding my skill set and spiritual gifts. And also he has been working in me personally and spiritually and challenging me and putting me in a lot of situations that I was unprepared for and kind of watching me swim but giving me the floaties that I needed to be able to get through it. </b><br><br>

					Addison: So what did you do professionally this summer for TWR?<br><br>

					<b>Charis: Mostly I played foosball. That was the number one thing on my job description. The secondary thing on my job description was drinking really great coffee. That was really good. I got to almost every morning taste some freshly roasted coffee that was made by some people by a department that was not even mine. So it was just a lot of interpersonal connections was a part of my job.</b><br><br>

					Addison: Good. Good. Next question. <br><br>

					(Everyone laughs.)<br><br> 

					<b>Charis: But in all seriousness I helped with a lot of process documentation and analysis for the various departments and regions of TWR so I worked not only with the people here in the Cary office but also with the ones who are in Africa and Europe and Asia and, you know, the moon but we don't talk about that one because its really really top secret.</b><br><br>

					Addison: So what do you feel like you've gained this summer?<br><br>

					<b>Charis: A boyfriend.</b><br><br>

					(Erik leaves the room.)<br><br>

					<b>Charis: I'm sorry could you repeat the question? </b><br><br>

					Addison: What do you feel like you've gained this summer?<br><br>

					<b>Charis: A lot of insight, a lot of ability to address situations, a lot of ability to just look up rather than look at my situations.To really focus on pursuing the Lord and relying on him for the strength to even pursue him. So that's what I feel like I've gained. A deeper understanding of how to do that in a variety of situations.</b><br><br>

					Addison: Good that sounds good. So could you describe your favorite memory from this summer?<br><br>

					<b>Charis: It's hard to choose one because I have so many good ones. My favorite memory from this summer. It's really hard because I have thoroughly enjoyed pretty much every single day I have been here. And every single day involves a lot of really really great memories. One of my favorite memories as a group was when we all went downtown to a couple of different museums and got to dance around in the rain. It was just a good time, it was really good to be able to be friends and to relate to one another and also grow. Another one of my favorite times is sitting around a campfire and talking about some really difficult things about the way that the Lord informs the way we address the world and being able to really build each other and challenge each other in these things. So I've really just enjoyed learning from everyone.</b><br><br>

					Addison: Good. So what would you say to prospective interns who are considering TWR?<br><br>

					<b>Charis: Do it. Keep walking through the doors. Don't shut any doors that the Lord has opened for you. Continue to walk through them. Puruse him first. If the Lord hasn't called you to an internship at TWR that's okay. But I dont know why he wouldn't. But definitely I would pursue the opportunity to have that conversation. Don't be afraid. It's an incredible experience.</b><br><br>

					Addison: Excellent. This has been Dateline: To Catch a Predator.<br><br><br>

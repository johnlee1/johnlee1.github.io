					Annie: Mr. Jones, I have a few questions for you that I would like you to answer to the best of your abilities. Are your ready? <br><br>

					<b>Erik: I would like to request a lawyer.</b><br><br>

					Annie: You are a lawyer, you can't say that. <br><br>

					<b>Erik: Alright, I'll answer to the best of my ability. Scout's honor. </b><br><br>

					Annie: Alright. How has God been working in your life this summer?<br><br>

					<b>Erik: I feel like I've answered this question to a taller, beardier, fuzzier man. I felt God working in my life in a lot of different ways this summer. Before I got to TWR I kind of made a conscious decision that in order to get through this summer and to do what I've felt God was leading me to do I needed to clean a lot of stuff out of my life. And I knew I could only do it with God supporting me and really being my strength through all of it. And I learned to rely a lot more on him, and by a lot more I mean entirely on him, and to guide me as I go. And I really felt that he has been able to give me the strength to juggle a lot of very big projects at the same time and to keep a long-term vision especially since my project will probably take me...I might have a day or two before the internship is over before I'm done with this whereas everyone else has a bunch of smaller projects and they've been able to kind of celebrate in their victories as they've been going through this summer because they completed a project and they have that satisfaction, that encouragement while I sit in this office and peck away at a keyboard for eight to ten hours a day for eight weeks. And so he's really given me a lot of strength and a lot of humility to get over my pride and myself and just get myself out of the way so that I, through him, could do work here for TWR.</b><br><br>

					Annie: Mhmkay. And then that kind of leads into the next question. What did you do this summer for TWR?<br><br>

					<b>Erik: I worked with the intellectual property rights department this summer and that really means, though I was tasked with a single project, which was to survey the legal landscape of every country that TWR has an office in, I was also really kind of pulled in a lot of different directions. Because IPR is so small as a department compared to any other aspect of TWR, at least in Cary. I was also responsible for going to a lot of meetings with our external lawyers and I was heavily involved with sort of the day-to-day of the IPR department. I was involved in all the meetings, I got to meet, you know, people who work halfway across the country to help us with intellectual property. And I got to meet a lot of awesome lawyers of faith and see how those two all work together and on top of that I worked in TWR360 and I am still doing some standard operating procedure documents for them in order to sort of help them teach new TWR360 administrators how to run TWR360 which was kind of fun and kind of scary at the same time, because I've never done anything like that and I had no idea what TWR360 was from an operations standpoint until I started doing that project. So I've been doing a lot of learning on the fly.</b><br><br>

					Annie: Okay and what do you feel like you've gained?<br><br>

					<b>Erik: Well I know I've lost a lot of sleep.</b><br><br>

					(Annie and John chuckle.)<br><Br>

					<b>Erik: That's a pretty broad question John.</b><br><br>

					John: Nikki came up with it. <br><br>

					(John thinks it's a good question.)<br><br>

					<b>Erik: I feel as though I've gained a new perspective on not only missions work, which I never really thought that would be something I would ever say because of how heavily involved in missions work my church is back home, but it has been very eye-opening first off to be living with missioanry kids. Getting to see a new perspective on that. At least one of them is as weird I figured they would be. </b><br><br>

					(Annie gives Erik a look.) <br><br>

					<b>Erik: But otherwise she's pretty nice. </b><br><br>

					Annie: How does that work? <br><br>

					<b>Erik: Hm?</b><br><br>

					Annie: Never mind. Continue. <br><br>

					<b>Erik: Also getting to see missions work from soemthing other than international travel, international evangelism. Getting to see it from a corporate standpoint, working in TWR corporate was very eye-opening in that I can see how talents that I have that I thought would never be applicable to a missions style occupation goal what-have-you I can put these things I've learned and these talents I have to use in advancing the kindgom in a way that, as I said, I never thought I would be able to do. Most of the time when I do missions work I kind of leave my academic credentials at the door and I roll up my sleeves and get my hands dirty because I'm willing to do that kind of grunt work and I felt like that is where I could apply myself since I wanted to do history and law. But being here being able to be like hey there's this need that a huge missions organization like TWR has and is ready and willing to fill with people like me is super awesome. So thats what I think I've gained. A new perspective and reinvigoration of my love for missions.</b><br><br>

					Annie: Okay and could you describe your favorite memory from this summer? <br><br>

					<b>Erik: My favorite memory from this summer is when I got off the plane back in Indianapolis. </b><br><br>

					(John laughs. Annie chuckles.) <br><br>

					Annie: What? <br><br>

					<b>Erik: Hasn't happened yet. </b><br><br>

					Annie: Okay.<br><br>

					<b>Erik: No my favorite memory this summer is probably when the IPR department was able to collaborate with our international partners to come to an agreement about a particular contract agreement. It was pretty cool, because all the international law research I had been doing this summer finally became sort of practical, and I could see how all the interlocked pieces of law operate between all the countries TWR has a presence in. Plus, I got the opportunity to be involved in all of the meetings and discussions with TWR's legal experts both in America and overseas, and seeing how we could all work together to figure out how to make the negotiations workable for everyone. It was awesome to see how God worked through the entire situation, and instead of letting the negotiations fracture, he used them to bring everyone closer and focus on our true purpose: spreading the gospel.</b><br><br>

					Annie: Very cool. So what would you say to prospective interns?<br><br>

					<b>Erik: To prospective interns?</b><br><br>

					Annie: Yes. <br><br>

					<b>Erik: Well it depends. I can't speak to all the people who are on the creative side. But to those interns who want to work in corporate I think you'll be in for the time for your life. TWR as a workplace is so much different than any other job, any other internship that you're going to have. And you're going to learn things about stuff you had no clue was a thing before you sat down to start your first day. You're going to make a ton of great friends who you're going to miss profoundly and deeply even before you leave. And you get to not only work for awesome people doing awesome things but you get to work for Christ and you get to advance the kingdom in a way that many people never have the opportunity to do. And so you should relish each and every moment you have here. And enjoy the relationships and the work that you do. That's what I would tell a prospective intern.</b><br><br>

					Annie: Okay thank you Erik. <br><br>

					(Annie claps.)<br><br>

					(John chuckles.) <br><br>

					John: You look like you're going to cry.<br><br>

					(John chuckles.)<br><br>

					<b>Erik: You can edit out the part I said about getting off the plane. I don't think that'll go over very well with HR.</b><br><br>

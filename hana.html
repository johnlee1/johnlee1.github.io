		  		<h2>the tech stack</h2>
				<p>The frontend is an angular 2 app served by nginx. The api backend is a nodejs app using hapi. Both nginx and node live in docker containers that are deployed on aws ec2 and configured by ecs. The nodejs app is connected to a mongodb database provided by mlab.</p>

		  		<h2>looking forward</h2>
				<p class="point"><b>design:</b> I am collaborating with a small team of designers in creating a style guide, vision guide, and story map. These will help establish the intended ux of the app which will inform how the ui will be built. We are paying special attention to what kind of user experience is most appropriate for a religious audience and what kind of user interface will reinforce the spiritual values of prayer.</p>
				<p class="point"><b>development:</b> I want to look into options for integrating CI/CD into the development workflow.</p>
				<p class="point"><b>infrastructure:</b> Currently the project is set up in a way that does not allow the frontend and backend to scale independently of each other since they are both configured to live on the same server instance. In the future it could possibly be beneficial to have a more flexible microservices setup that allows independent horizontal scaling.</p>

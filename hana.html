                        Hana is a web application that provides a platform for sharing prayer requests. The goal is to make an application that connects people through prayer but without replacing real-life community. Hana is currently in beta. A full front-end rewrite is on the way.

                        Hana is designed for those who want to pray. An expected common use case of this application is learning how to pray for others when it is not possible to directly ask them for prayer requests. This could be helpful when praying for missionaries, missions organizations, world events, or people groups.

                        Hana is being designed collaboratively with a user-centric approach through story mapping, empathy mapping, iteration, and user testing. The intended tone to be achieved with Hana can be described with the following: informative, encourages reflection, simple. The ux/ui sholud be designed with these in mind.

                        The frontend is an angular 2 app served by nginx. The api backend is a nodejs app using hapi. Both nginx and node live in docker containers that are deployed with aws ecs. The containers live in ec2 instances and are fronted by amazon's elastic load balancer. The nodejs app is connected to a mongodb database provided by mlab. DNS is handled with namecheap and aws route53. Version control is handled with git and github.

                        I want to create a more automated process for developing, building, and deploying the applications by looking into more options for ci/cd. In regards to infrastructure, currently the project is set up in a way that does not allow the frontend and backend to scale independently of each other since they are both configured to live on the same server instance. In the future it could possibly be beneficial to have a more flexible microservices setup that allows independent horizontal scaling.

                    <div class="chunkRight">
                        A feature I'll be looking into adding is the insertion of sentiment-appropriate and topic-appropriate bible verses in the prayer mode slideshow. Once there is enough data (~50,000 prayer posts with manually added labels), I want to train a machine learning model to classify future prayer posts based on sentiment (happy, sad, etc) and topic (relationships, missions, etc). This model can then be used to classify future prayer posts. In this way, during a prayer mode slideshow, context-relevant bible verses (pre-selected to be associated with a sentiment/topic) can appear along with the classified prayer posts. Options for creating the model includes using google's prediciton api, TF-IDF kmeans with scikit-learn, and LDA or LSA with gensim. A vocabulary of prayer posts could be too sparse for good classification without a vector representaiton of words. One challenge is getting from word vectors to a good document representation (doc2vec) that works for clustering as most clustering algorithms require a fixed-length document vector.

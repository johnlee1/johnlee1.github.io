                        My name is John Lee. 
                        <br>
                        I currently reside in Tokyo, Japan. I have 3 years of professional software engineering experience
                        in the United States. I spent a year working on

                        and 2 years working on 
                        <a href="https://www.lucasware.com/jennifer-intelligence/" target="_blank">Jennifer</a>. 
                        In my previous two jobs I worked mainly with C# and Javascript. 
                        Now I'm taking on the challenge of learning an even tougher language—Japanese—at the language school I attend.

					Lanelle: Hello Benjamin.<br><br>

					<b>Benjamin: Hi.</b><br><br>

					Lanelle: How are you?<br><br>

					<b>Benjamin: I am tired.</b><br><br>

					Lanelle: Sorry.<br><br>

					<b>Benjamin: It's ok.</b><br><br>

					Lanelle: Ok, we're going to interview you.<br><br>

					<b>Benjamin: Cool.</b><br><br>

					Lanelle: What did you this summer for TWR?.<br><br>

					<b>Benjamin: I worked with the IT department in TWR Singapore to develop a web-based application to generate statistics for the TWR website. These statistics include how many people listen to given shows on that website and also things like how big the file sizes are for the different shows and how long they are. Those sort of things. Yea.</b><br><br>

					Lanelle: Yea. That's cool.<br><br>

					<b>Benjamin: There you go. That's the best description I can give you. </b><br><br>

					Lanelle: Ok. That's a lot. How has God been working in your life this summer?<br><br>

					<b>Benjamin: Since I moved to Singapore I had to kind of get use to an entirely different culture and also lifestyle. So I felt like God really taught me to rely on him, more than I ever had to in the past. There you go.</b><br><br>

					Lanelle: Alright, cool. What do you feel like you've gained?<br><br>

					<b>Benjamin. I feel like professionally I've gained experience working with more software and programs than I ever have before. Personally I think I've gained a lot of knowledge of cultures overseas and also what it is like to live in a different country as part of a different culture. And then spiritually I think I have learned how to rely on God more and also how different cultures experiences God very differently than we do here. </b><br><br>

					Lanelle: Could you describe your favorite memory from this summer? <br><br>

					<b>Benjamin: Ah man. This is hard, this is hard. I'm like going through the database of mind.</b><br><br>

					(Lanelle laughs.) <br><br>

					<b>Benjamin. I'm trying to pull out something. Ok. So for my birthday, me and all the other guys from the IT department went to a place in Singapore and we all played pool late on my birthday. So that was a lot of fun. </b><br><br>

					Lanelle: Oh that's cool. That's awesome. Ok, so with that, what would you say to future interns?<br><br>

					<b>Benjamin: I would say specifically if you are going internationally, try to be prepared ahead of time. Don't leave anythign to the lsat minute because if you do it might not get done or it might not get done as well as it should get done. And also just to try to relax as much as you can and try not to worry about anything because in the end everything is going to be ok. No matter what happens with flights or living in a different culture, it's going to be ok. It'll work out, they'll take care of you. Ultimately God is in control. So just leave it to him and trust that he's got your best in mind. So you never have to be anxious or worried about anything like that. </b><br><br>

					Lanelle: That's great. <br><br>
					
					<b>Benjamin: Alright. </b><br><br>

					Lanelle: Thank you Ben. <br><br>

					<b>Benjamin: Thank you! </b><br><br><br>

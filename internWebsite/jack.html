					- Take 1 - <br><br>

					Nikki: Okay state your name, age, and major. <br><br>

					<b>Jack: My name is Bob Blahblah. I'm 65 and I went to Duke and I majored in law. </b><br><br><br>

					- Take 2 - <br><br>

					Nikki: Alright, so if you could just state your name, age, and major. <br><br>

					<b>Jack: I'm John Lee, I'm 21 years old, and I'm an engineer. </b><br><br>

					Nikki: Alright John, so tell me a little bit about how God has been working in your life this summer. Or wait, can you start off with what you did? <br><br>

					<b>Jack: Huh? </b><br><br>

					Nikki: Tell me a little about what you've been doing this summer. <br><br>

					<b>Jack: I've been walking around the office asking people if they have time for a quick chat. </b> <br><br>

					Nikki: Why did you choose him to do this interview? <br><br>

					John: Well, I was going to do everyone. <br><br>

					Nikki: You know it's going to take like an hour. <br><br>

					(Everyone laughs.) <br><br>

					<b>Jack: Okay I'll do serious this time. </b><br><br>

					Nikki: Are you sure you can do this? <br><br><br>

					- Take 3 - <br><br>

					Nikki: Alright if you could state your name, age, and major. <br><br>

					<b>Jack: My name is Lauren Libby and I'm...alright my name is Jack Birdsall, I'm 19, and I'm a radio, television, film major at Northwestern University</b><br><br>

					Nikki: So tell me a little about what you've been doing here at TWR this summer. <br><br>

					<b>Jack: I've been a video production intern. I scratch backs, I get the coffee, and I cook the nuggets. And Charis sometimes she comes in and she makes all these arduous claims and accusations and I say get out, and then she leaves, but not without filing a report. Her husband Borris comes around with his stick and tries to intimidate me but I just fill out one of his comment cards and just check the box for 'somewhat satisfied' and that gets to him. I'm a video producer. I do logging and other various tasks. Sometimes Tyler will give me videos to direct. Basically I'm just a helping hand in the visual media department.</b><br><br>

					Nikki: Can you talk a little bit about the visual media department or TWR as a whole and what your role is in the bigger picture? <br><br>

					<b>Jack: TWR has been extremely welcoming from the beginning to about the second day. </b><br><br>

					(Jack laughs loudly.)<br><br>

					<b>Jack: Uhm no, I've been very touched by how welcomed I felt in TWR and especially visual media. I feel like if I were to invest more time and energy into that department and work full-time it would be a very good fit for me. And I like the people. They're nice.</b><br><br>

					Nikki: What is the visual media department's role? Tell me a little about them.<br><br>

					<b>Jack: Right now their role is promoting staff and promoting TWR ministry's tools through videos. So that's just making videos about appointed staff who are raising support that they can show to their supporting churches to help compel their friends and family to support them. And we also make videos that advertise things like TWR360, our online platform, and other things like this video called "The First Sixty" which is celebrating the first sixty years of TWR's history.</b><br><br>

					Nikki: So personally how do you feel God has been working in your life this summer? <br><br>

					<b>Jack: Not a lot of people know this but I was actually on crutches before I came here, no I'm kidding.</b><br><br>

					(Jack laughs.) <br><br>

					<b>Jack: I think God has been doing a lot in showing how the way I perceive myself is kind of wrong. I'm either really too into myself or just really...and it has shown I've been learning a lot about how either I'm really into myself or really hate myself but either way I'm just really obsessed with myself. And I've been learning about humility, I've been learning about the rewards of spending a lot of time with the Lord. I've been blessed with a lot of people who have been really good examples to me. They've been really good examples to follow in terms of their spiritual habits and I've been trying to mirror them. Yea.</b><br><br>

					Nikki: That's really awesome, Jack. <br><br>

					<b>Jack: Thank you Jebeckka. </b><br><br>

					Nikki: So through all this, what do you feel like you can take away from this summer? <br><br>

					<b>Jack: That all is vanity, and there is nothing new under the sun. If you become a missionary, it's not that hard because we're all going to die anyways. Like, like, if I join TWR, great, if I dont, that's fine. And I found a place where I can combine my faith and my talents. </b><br><br>

					Nikki: That's awesome. Can you describe maybe your favorite memory here at TWR so far? <br><br>

					<b>Jack: When Nikki left. </b><br><br>

					(Jack laughs.) <br><br>

					<b>Jack: My favorite memory at TWR might have been some of the jam sessions I've had with John over in good ole room 15. Where we sing really loud and everyone in the hall hears us but nobody can join us because it's our room.</b><br><br>

					Nikki: I join you from my room. <br><br>

					<b>Jack: Ok. Nobody can come into the room. Because we might be naked, but we might not be, but you'll never know. I think best memories of the internship, probably the guy-ble studies where I've been very open. Guy-ble is where all the male interns in Cary meet up and share our lives and our deep thoughts. Those times have been very good for bonding and for growth and for helping each other out without the ladies to distract us.</b><br><br>

					Nikki: It sounds like you've had a really great experience here in Cary. What would you say to someone who is interested in doing an internship here? <br><br>

					<b>Jack: Well first you have to fill out a preliminiary questionaire and then you apply.</b><br><br>

					(Addison laughs in the background.)<br><br>

					Nikki: Sorry John, there's not much I can do here. <br><br>

					(Addison laughs in the background.)<br><br>

					Nikki: Thank you Jack, it was a pleasure. <br><br>

					(Jack laughs.) <br><br><br>

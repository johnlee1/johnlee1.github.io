					Interviewer: So what did you do with TWR this summer?<br><br>

					<b>Jeremy: I worked on machines. I played with a lot of kids. Used them as human shields when playing dodgeball. Threw some kids around. Worked on more machines. Learned how to drive and operate all the machines and learned a lot about how the BTS site works. </b><br><br>

					Interviewer: And where were you? <br><br>

					<b>Jeremy: I was in Parakou, Benin. </b><br><br>

					Interviewer: Benin. West Africa.<br><br>

					<b>Jeremy: Yes. West Africa. </b><br><br>

					Interviewer: Alright good. And what kind of machines were you working with?<br><br>

					<b>Jeremy: I was working with tractors, bulldozers, generators, gensets, big gensets, two of them.</b><br><br>

					Interviewer: So engineering.<br><br>

					<b>Jeremy: Engineering, yea. </b><br><br>

					Interviewer: Mechanical engineering.<br><br>

					<b>Jeremy: Mechanical engineering, yea.</b><br><br>
										
					Interviewer: Alright so what is something God has been working in you this summer?<br><br>

					<b>Jeremy: This summer for me is like being more in-tune with the Holy Spirit, really learning more about what it means to be sensitive and be led by the Spirit. And to seek the Spirit so that I can see the fruits of the Spirit come to life.</b><br><br>
										
					Interviewer: So aside from that spiritual implication what do you feel like you've gained from this summer?<br><br>

					<b>Jeremy: Aside?</b><br><br>
										
					Interviewer: Aside from the spiritual.<br><br>

					<b>Jeremy: I gained a lot of relationships. I really got to know the community, got to know a lot of the kids, got to know a whole bunch of missionaries, met some of the locals, hanged out with a lot of technicians. So I met a lot of friends and made relationships during this trip.</b><br><br>
										
					Interviewer: Cool. Could you describe your foundest memory from this summer?<br><br>

					<b>Jeremy: My foundest memory?</b><br><br>
										
					Interviewer: That is foundest right?<br><br>

					John: Favorite.<br><br>

					Interviewer: Favorite! Ok, that works too. <br><br>

					<b>Jeremy: I guess just like really getting to know people. And just getting to know the hearts of the people. </b><br><br>

					Interviewer: The hearts of the people. So there's a lot of people involved in this whole summer. It seems like you had a lot of good interactions. <br><br>

					<b>Jeremy: Hmhmm. I got to know just the culture and the religion, and just what people struggle with and just how the churches operate. </b><br><br>

					Interviewer: So how do you think what you've learned these past couple of months will impact your going back to school and life moving forward? How do you see the direct correlation?<br><br>

					<b>Jeremy: Well I'm a missionary back at home so I do college ministry and a lot of what I learn I bring back. I have the heart to really lead the people in my community to have a more deeper faith. And I see how important it is because of what I've seen in Benin and I really want to journey with people to a place of growth with Christ. </b><br><br>

					Interviewer: So what would you say to future interns of TWR? Kids coming in. What are some words of things you've learned or things you would like to pass on? <br><br>

					<b>Jeremy: Be expected to just take the initiative. Really be intentional. Take the time to really get to know the hearts of the people. Because I feel like relationships are what God has intended us for. </b><br><br>

					Interviewer: Well thank you very much. <br><br>

					<b>Jeremy: Right on. </b><br><br>

					Interviewer: Good answers.<br><br>

					<b>Jeremy: For sure.</b><br><br>

					Interviewer: Alright. <br><br><br>

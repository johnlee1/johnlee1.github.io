					Addison: Hello, I'm here with one of our interns, John. John could you say your full name and what your position is for TWR?<br><br>

					<b>John: My full name is John Whan Lee. At TWR I'm doing coding. </b><br><br>

					Addison: Cool. So, tell me John, how has God been working in your life this summer?<br><br>

					<b>John: God has really shown me the beauty of friendship, community, hospitality, joy, laughter, and these are things I want to carry with me for the rest of my life. </b><br><br>


					Addison: Cool. That's good, that's really good. So you said you are doing coding for TWR. Can you kind of give details of what that means?<br><br>

					<b>John: Yes. This summer I created a web application using Laravel, which is a PHP web application framework. And the web app is used to help better manage the phone system here at TWR. It was a lot of fun to make it and I learned a lot.</b><br><br>


					Addison: Cool. <br><br>

					<b>John: Yea. </b><br><br>


					Addison: I like that. That's cool. So, what do you feel like you've gained this summer? <br><br>

					<b>John: I think I've gained a lot of professional experience in terms of coding. I've also gained a lot of awesome friends and I'm really appreciative of them. And ah. I've learned so much from all the other interns and seeing their walk with God. And I'm just so thankful for TWR staff who have been role models for me during my time here this summer. And I think I've gotten a lot closer to God as well because of all these interactions with all the people who are here at TWR. And being closer to God is, yea that's good.</b><br><br>


					Addison: Good. That is good. So, could you describe your favorite memory from this summer. <br><br>

					<b>John: Yes. Well I really enjoy church service every week. I really enjoy spending time with everyone. But one of my favorite moments is when I'm just alone in the office or in my room and I'm just thinking about the interns and I'm just so amazed by how God has been working in the interns. And I'm just so thankful to God for what he is doing in our lives. And like, I just have these solitary moments of deep appreciation for the interns and what God is doing through us and in us. And it's so amazing and beautiful how God is transforming us, sanctifying us, using us, and guiding us.</b><br><br>


					Addison: It is, it really is. <br><br>

					<b>John: Yea. </b><br><br>


					Addison: So with all that in mind, what would you say to prospective interns who are considering working for TWR?<br><br>

					<b>John: I think you should pray about it. Yes. Trust God and he will guide you.</b><br><br>


					Addison: Cool. Thank you very much John. You can take off the blindfold now.<br><br>

					<b>John: Ok.</b><br><br><br>

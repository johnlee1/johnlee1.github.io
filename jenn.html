					John: Hello! <br><br>

					<b>Jenn: Hello!</b><br><br>

					John: So what did you do for TWR this summer? <br><br>

					<b>Jenn: I worked in the finance department. I helped analysis financial reports and did an internal control check.</b><br><br>

					John: Cool. And how has God been moving in your life this summer? <br><br>

					<b> Jenn: God has taught me about His character, that He is faithful, good, pursues me, and uses everything to glorify himself. He has also shown me what my professional passions are. </b><br><br>

					John: What do you feel like you've gained this summer?  <br><br>

					<b>Jenn: I've learned that there are a lot of different pieces within a financial department and how much work it takes to make the financial department run. </b><br><br>

					John: Cool. What is your favorite memory from this summer? <br><br>

					<b>Jenn: I loved meeting the staff at TWR and getting to hear their stories of how they've followed God and about all the different places they've lived while working for TWR. I also loved daily devotions time with the entire TWR staff and weekly intern meetings. At the weekly intern meetings we got to hear about what everyone was working on, what God was teaching them, and then pray for each other. </b><br><br> 

					John: And what would you say to a prospective intern? <br><br> 

					<b> Jenn: I would say TWR is a great organization, they have a heart for reaching all peoples everywhere and building up the church around the world. </b><br><br>

					John: Alright, cool. Thank you! <br><br><br>

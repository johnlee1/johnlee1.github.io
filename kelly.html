					Erik: Kelly, please state your full name. <br><br>

					<b> Kelly: Kelly Jo Gilbert. </b> <br><br>

					Erik: Kelly, how has God been working in your life this summer? <br><br>

					<b> Kelly: Oh, that is a very loaded question. See, ok. </b> <br><br>

					Erik: That's not loaded. <br><br>

					<b> Kelly: No because there is a lot of things I could say. Ok. </b> <br><br>

					Erik: Pick two, pick your favorite two. <br><br>

					<b> Kelly: My favorite two. Ok. Can you restate the question? </b> <br><br>

					Erik: How has God been working in your life? <br><br>

					<b> Kelly: One of the things that I would say he has definitely been teaching me and been working on in me has a lot to do with...throughout all my years at school, I had a lot of issues with confidence and what I did. And being here and seeing God working through people, no matter who they are, people who came into TWR doing one thing, and then years later down the road they needed a new spot filled, so they were trained to do that, and eventually able to do that and take on a role where somebody was needed. That's been really cool to see. And I spent the first week coming in being like I really hope I'm doing well, I hope that they like what I'm doing and that I actually can do this and it's not just something I've been learning for years and I can't actually do it. And within the first couple weeks, working alongside Andy, who is my supervisor, who is a very encouraging person and a very excellent teacher, and learning that I can do this, but not only that, I can't do this on my own, this is not something I just do. God has given me some natural talents and tendencies that he is then able to use through me for his purposes and for his glory. And its not on my shoulders to be the best possible version of a producer that I can be, or a scriptwriter. Just remembering to wake up daily and saying "okay God, how do you want to use me today?". I want to do things for you and not for my own pride or my own glory. I want to do it for yours. And doing that everyday has been something that he's really been teaching me how to do better because I spent all this years at school being like I have to do well on this test, I have to do well on this project with my own skills that I have instead of saying ok you gave me these skills, you gave me these desires, now use them how you want to use them, use me how you want to use me. </b> <br><br>

					Erik: So what you're saying basically is that you feel now you've been instilled with the confidence that, even though the job that is being presented to you potentially going forward is really exactly what you want to do with your life, you're ready and willing to drop that to do whatever God calls you to do. <br> <br> 

					<b>Kelly: Exactly and also realizing that yes I'm doing the work but I couldn't be doing it if it was not what he wanted to do with me, if its not what how he wanted to use me. Does that make sense? </b><br> <br>

					Erik: Yea. <br> <br>

					<b>Kelly: I guess, just, and like I no longer focus on "I have confidence in myself" but I have confidence in the fact that God is using me, God is working in me, and He is doing the work that he wants to do, and he happens to be using me to do it. Does that make sense? </b><br><br> 

					Erik: Yea. It's your answer so it always makes sense. <br> <br>

					(Kelly audibly agrees.)<br> <br>

					Erik: Other than taking paid naps, what all did you do for TWR this summer? <br> <br>

					(Kelly laughs.) <br> <br>

					<b> Kelly: I spent the first month working on five different programs that were companion pieces to the TWR magazine. They covered five different areas of the world that have been going through periods of crisis. For example, we did Nepal, which recently had a devasting earthquake. We also did a recap of everything that has been going on in Haiti the past 5 years or so since the earthquake. And then also Ukraine which has been experiencing war for a couple of years. And then the Middle East which is experiencing a variety of things. And also Kenya. So I did some interviewing of people and I did a lot of editing of those interviews. And then I recorded people who did transitions and intros to that and laid music under them and put them together as five to eight minute long segments that are going up on the website for people to listen to as more in-depth stories to what is already in the magazine and to hear personal accounts from people who are actually there or who have been there and know exactly what is going on and the exact effects these crisis situations are having on these countries and what TWR is doing specifically to provide relief, to provide hope, and to provide healing in those situations. </b><br><br>

					Erik: And how has this experience grown you? <br> <br>

					<b> Kelly: It really has shown me how big God is and how big the world is and that he's not just the God of my life but he's the God of the whole world. and that you know in some small world i'm sitll a part of that whole world but theres so much more going on then what is going on right here. and you know, he's not htere just becasue we're there, he's there already. its was veyr eye opening to see al l that and to ehar all htose things and to meet these people from all over the wolrd whom God is using in these questions. </b><br> <br>
					
					(Erik whispers to John.) <br><br>

					<b>Kelly: Huh? You knew that was what I was going to say?</b><br><br>

					Erik: No I said your hair looks pretty, that's all. What is it that you have feel like you've gained professionally, spritually, and socially this summer? <br><br>

					<b>Kelly: Well I definitely gained a lot of experience in production, in writing, and in interacting with people. I have spent time in school working on projects whenever there were projects that needed to be done. I've never done this as a job. But being here for a whole month and constantly working really helped me learn a lot more. And honestly it was very different being in school and doing these things because I was doing it for a different purpose than why I'm doing it now. And I've been enjoying it so much more doing it here than I ever did in school which is nice because some people they do it in shcool and they love it and then they get into the real world and they hate it. But I have absolutely loved doing everything I have done. Some of it is hard, some of it is difficult, but those can be good things and I've really enjoyed it. And spiritually I kind of already talked about earlier, God opening my eyes to the bigger picture and opening my eyes to the fact that yea I'm the one here doing stuff but he's really the one who's really doing things and he's using me to do those things. And that's very freeing to realize that I put on a lot of weight on myself and I dont have to do that, I just have be wiling to follow him and be willing to surrender myself to him everyday and to whatever he has for me to do. Because I know what I want and I can see where he is leading but in the end it may be very different to where I think its heading. And just the peole who have been here, it's a very different environment from what I was expecting exactly but from day one everyone here has cared about the interns. Everyone has cared about us as people, not just what we can contribute to the organization. And realizing that you can still do that and still do your job has been an awesome experience. And it's weird to think I've only known a lot of people for two months. </b> <br><br>

					Erik: you've talked about applying all these htings youve learned for the first time. <br><br> 

					K: yea

					E: What...how do I word this question...what has that transition been like? i know you said you enjoyed it but when you finally realized this is a transformation from skilsl to application., how has that kind of molded you in a way? <br><br>

					K all four ehyars at school i was never fully sure I was doing hte right thing with my major. i was never fully sure iw as in the right major. and so being here has been very affirming of that which has been kind of a whilrwind. because i mean its nice to have that. i dont know if i was expecting that or not. i was kind of expecting it to being goin one way or another. and be like this is going to this is solid proof i did the right thing or okay this was fun, you're probably going to be doing something else. and everything i've done here, has somehow related to something that i learned in school. which is crazy. and I'm still wrapping my head around the whole thing honestly. Looking back four hyears ago i had no idea why i picked my major. I can not telly ou why id di it. and throughout hte first two years no i dont want to do radio no i dont want to do radio no i dont want to do radio. and then finally my third year saying okay yea i kinda want to do radio and then giving it a shot and realizing i love hte production aspect i love the erlational aspect i love all tehse things about me okay i'm going to pursue it and then landing here and then having someone like andy and someone like jon whos been in radio for years and saying hey you can actually do this we want you to do this. it really shows me how GOd has worked through this whole thing to get me to wehre i am. And how that has ...Sorry what exactly was the question?

					E How has hte application fo the skills you ahve learned has gornw you and shown you why you're comfortable here.

					Just realizing that from four years ago I"ve been doing exactly what he wanted to to get me here.

					Mmm

					Without knowing it

					Mmm

					Has been 

					Crazy

					Itrs been so incredible tos ee that and to be able to experience that and to say id idnt make a terrible mistake four eyars ago i didnt do the exact wrong thing because i hve no idea why id ecieded to do that.so i know tjhat it was him somehow orchestrating all fo that to get me here 

					mmhhmm

					and fully realizing that ok yea maybe i dont have a future here, mayberi'll have a future here for 3 yers and then i'll go onto something else. but for now i know i'm exactly where he wanted me to be four eyars ago. and i guess that answers your question and its very herd to articulate becfaue its so new and i knew in a year and i'll be able to explain better but for now thats what i got.

					describe your favor ite memory from this summer and why its yours favorite memory

					i liked it when we picked up Nikki from the airport, well we didn't pick her up, we greeted her at hte aiport, and we werent sure we were going to be there on time to see her and we ended up being like an the look on he rface when she saw us there was priceless and she was just so happy that we showed up. We all erally love NIkki and we all missed her a lot so it was really good to see hera gain. 

					E tahts it thats the best you got?

					the time when  i punched erik in the arm and he bruised up for a month, that was one of my fravorite memories

					doesnt suprise me one bit

					or when lanenelle and i beat eirk and addison at fuseball

					lannelle is pretty gerat too. she and i went to lunch one day and that was a lot of fun. 

					I have no regrests about htis summer

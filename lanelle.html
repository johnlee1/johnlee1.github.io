					Annie: Hello Lanelle! <br><br>

					<b>Lanelle: Hello Annie!</b><br><br>

					Annie: I have a few questions for you.<br><br>

					<b>Lanelle: Ok.</b><br><br>

					Annie: So how has God been working in your life this summer? <br><br>

					<b>Lanelle: In regards to the internship, I would say that one of the biggest things the Lord is teaching me is that I have to take everyday at about ten minutes at a time. It's just whatever the Lord puts in front of you. And then instead of trying to plan my future I have to do whatever the Lord puts in front of me and be willing to obey in whatever he asks me to do. So I think that's probably the biggest thing I learned this summer. </b><br><br>

					Annie: So a lot of trust. <br><br>

					<b>Lanelle: Yea there you go! That's what it is.</b><br><br>

					Annie: What did you do this summer for TWR? <br><br>

					<b>Lanelle: Wel,, I worked primarily with Rivercross and their organization that is creating a radio drama for trauma-healing training for caregivers. So I worked primarily with them on transcribing video for them, and logging video for them, as well as some research and reading for them. Also I ended up doing a lot of other things. So I ended up working with a lot of the SIP department, which is Strategic Initiatves and Partnerhips, so I worked with Marvin on a radio drama called Portraits of Hope. And then I've also helped Sandi out a little bit with her radio station. And then I also got to do a little bit with Project Hannah and voicing with that. So I've gotten to do a little of everything. Oh and I got to work with graphci design, so I'm kind of in a little bit of everywhere.</b><br><br>

					Annie: Yea. Ok. So what do you feel like you've gained?<br><br>

					<b>Lanelle: Ok so what I feel like I've gained is a lot actually. I came in without any expectations. And so I feel like I've grown a lot professionally, spiritually, and emotionally. Professionally I've learned that I have skills that are useful and the Lord can really actually use my love for media to spread the gospel elsewhere, which I didn't really know if those two were compatible. And then spiritually I've just grown a lot with the trust thing and getting to know my supervisors. It's been really good. </b><br><br>

					Annie: So. Could you describe your favorite memory from this summer?<br><br>

					<b>Lanelle: I have to pick one?</b><br><br>

					Annie: See that's what I said. <br><br>

					(Short pause.)<br><br>

					Annie: Pick a memory out of your favorites group and name it. <br><br>

					<b>Lanelle: Ok. I loved going to see Jurassic World with everybody and being scared out of my mind. That was fun.</b><br><br>

					Annie: Yea. <br><br>

					<b>Lanelle: I don't know if that's my favorite though.</b><br><br>

					Annie: Ok well then name then your top several favorites. <br><br>

					<b>Lanelle: Oh I know. My birthday was this summer so I celebrated probably four different times throughout the office because I work wtih several different departments.</b><br><br>

					Annie: Did you get lots of cake?<br><br>

					<b>Lanelle: I did, I had so much cake that weekend. The SIP department surprised me with a cake and Addison sang a song. And during staff meeting they all sang to me again the next day. And then Kelly made me a cake the day after that. And my family had cake. So I just had cake. Lots and lots of cake.</b><br><br>

					Annie: Cake is good. <br><br>

					<b>Lanelle: Yea, it was great.</b><br><br>

					Annie: Ok. So. Suppose there are prospective interns who want to come and work for TWR. What would you say to them?<br><br>

					<b>Lanelle: Brush up on your fuseball skills.</b><br><br>

					(Everybody laughs.)

					<b>Lanelle: This is an awesome organization and you should totally join it. I really support everything that it does. It's really important that media is used to spread the gospel because there is a lot of people who are not necessarily literate and can't read. So I think radio is a great way to share the gospel with people. And also to build local churches in areas that we as Americans can't get into easily. So if you want to be a part of what the Lord is doing you should defnitely join TWR. The end.</b><br><br>

					Annie: The end. Cool. Thank you Lanelle, it's been fantastic!<br><br><br>

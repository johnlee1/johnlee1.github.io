					John: Alright hello. <br><br>

					<b>Nikki: Hey.</b><br><br>

					John: Could you state your full name?<br><br>

					<b>Nikki: Jessica Nicole Beck.</b><br><br>

					John: Could you describe what you did for TWR this summer?<br><br>

					<b>Nikki: This summer I was an intern in the videography department, so I actually went to Asia to film listeners' tesimonies which are people who have been impacted by TWR's radio ministry. So I went and filmed in two places overseas, Indonesia and the Philippines, and now I'm back editing that footage and putting it together so that we can send it to local churches to show what we're doing through missions.</b> <br><br>

					John: Cool, what is one thing you've learned about God in Asia? <br><br>

					<b>Nikki: I learned a lot about his goodness overall. I learned about his ability to go to whatever means, whatever ends, to reconcile his children to himself. Yea I think I just learned that he is doing a million different things in the most unlikely places. That we can't always, we don't always know what is going on behind the scenes. There's not a place where he isn't at work, and there's nothing he can't use, and there's no place that's beyond his reach. And he's just not like how you expect him to be, sometimes he's just different. </b><br><br>

					John: Cool, and how would you say God has been working in your life this summer, and what have you gained? <br><br>

					<b>Nikki: Yea it has been a really humbling summer. I think God has just really humbled me in a lot of ways continually, like throughout this past year. Showing me what it means to serve well, what it means to be in the background and on the sidelines and kind of just meet whatever need there is in front of me. He's showing me that I dont have to plan or know exactly what he's doing, I just have to be present, and trust that he's in control. And he's just continually showing me more of himself. And I feel like I've just gained a bigger picture of who he is and who I am in him. </b> <br><br>

					John: Could you describe your favorite memory from this summer? <br><br>

					<b>Nikki: You know I had some great experiences with some of the listeners. And in Indonesia I got to really spend time with their families and there was this one time when all of the whole video team went out to dinner with the listeners stories family and the listeners coordinators family and it was like 25 people at this huge table at KFC in the middle of Bali. Because they love that American, they think all Americans love fried chicken so they take us there when they can. And we were just all sitting around the table and everyone was so happy and they kept thanking us and telling us how much it meant that we flew across the world to see them. And I felt like we were way more grateful that they had allowed us to come into their lives and see that. And it was just a time when I knew I may never see those people again, but in that moment, we were together, we had this bond, even though I've only known them for two days. So yea. It was amazing.</b><br><br>

					John: Do you have anything to say to prospective interns? <br><br>

					<b>Nikki: Just that you know, coming here, you may have a lot of expectations, and a lot of an idea of what it's going to look like, and just to let those go, probably as soon as possible, because it's going to look different. And what you think you're going to learn you're probably going to learn completely the opposite because it's usually how God works. Just to come open and be flexible. And really invest and put your all in while you can because you can gain a lot here, and, you know, God doesn't waste any time. So yea.</b><br><br>

					John: Cool. <br><br>

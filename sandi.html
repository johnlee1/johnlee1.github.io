					<b>Sandi: Hello. </b><br><br>

					John: Hello. Could you describe what you did this summer for TWR?<br><br>

					<b>Sandi: This summer I did research and contacted independent christian artists for an internet radio project that we're trying to put together. I did research on what kind of radio stream technology we'll be able to use for that. I did some research on what our audience would respond to. I listened to a lot of music and I contacted and sent a lot of emails to a lot of artists. It was rewarding but it was also difficult.</b><br><br>


					John: Cool. How would you say God has been working in your life this summer?<br><br>

					<b>Sandi: Oh boy. God has been teaching me that transitional periods are ok. I'm a semester away from graduating. He's just reminding me so much that he is in control, it's not up to me, and if my desires are for his will to be done, then there are no wrong answers. So yea, that's what God has been teaching me. When you are praying for his will to be done your prayers are obviously going to be answered.</b><br><br>


					John: What do you feel like you've gained?<br><br>

					<b>Sandi: I've gained a deeper understanding of the SIP department at TWR. They do a lot of partnering and just being a part of that process and really starting to understand how much effort it takes for us to get just one program done, or even one project conceptualized, it's endless man-hours and it's endless, you know, talking to people and relating to people that you may find hard to relate to or are hard to contact. What else have I gained? I've gained a really deep understanding and respect for artists. Especially like Addison and others who are giving of themselves in order to create good content so that people will want to listen to our message. I have a large respect for them. I've gained a lot of friends. Friends are good.</b><br><br>


					John: Could you describe your favorite memory?<br><br>

					<b>Sandi: Probably whenever we went to Benjamin's house. It was just a good time of fellowship and bringing each other's burdens before one another for prayer. </b><br><br>


					John: Cool. <br><br>

					<b>Sandi: Yea. </b><br><br>


					John: And what would you say to prospective interns?<br><br>

					<b>Sandi: Talk to people in the office, not just your fellow interns. Get to know some of the other workers around here. Some of them have given me some of the best life adivce ever. Last year they told us that there is over 600 years of ministry expereince in this building. Also when you socialize with your fellow interns, just be sure to observe them carefully. And what I mean by that is just get to know them in a way that you're loving them as God would love them. Just be encouraging and have fun.</b><br><br>

					John: Alright, thank you Sandi.<br><br>

					<b>Sandi: You're welcome. Woohoo!</b><br><br><br>

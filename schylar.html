					Jeremy: Ok, so, what is your name?<br><br>

					<b>Schylar: Schylar.</b><br><br>

					Jeremy: Schylar. Right on. So, where did you go?<br><br>

					<b>Schylar: To Bonaire, which is an island in Southern Caribbean.</b><br><br>

					Jeremy: Cool beans, cool beans. So how has God been working in your life this summer?<br><br>

					<b>Schylar: I think God just really like humbled me this summer. This is the first summer that I've been involved in a ministry where I wasn't on the frontlines, like witnessing to people face-to-face all the time and seeing fruits being produced. So this summer I was more behind-the-scenes and it was a really humbling experience to trust that God was using my efforts for his glory without seeing that glory being revealed the whole summer.</b><br><br>
					
					Jeremy: Awesome. Cool beans, cool beans. So what did you do this summer for TWR?<br><br>

					<b>Schylar: I was a mechanical engineering intern in Bonaire. I was climbing the transmitter towers and analyzing the thickness of the steel. </b><br><br>
					
					Jeremy: Cool beans, cool beans. What do you feel like you've gained? <br><br>

					<b>Schylar: I feel like over the summer I've gained a lot more patience and I learned how to be more flexible in my plans because there were a lot of times where like if the weather was bad we couldn't climb the towers, so I had to find something else to do  or another way to serve. So I had to be really flexible and I also had to be really patient with other people around me.</b><br><br>
					
					Jeremy: Mhmm. Being patient is really cool. Could you describe your favorite memory from this summer? <br><br>

					<b>Schylar: I was snorkling one day after work across the street from the office and I found an octopus and as I watched it, it shoved it's tentacles in it's funnels, which is where it breathes from, and it looked like it was sticking it's fingers in it's ears and making a face at me. And I thought it was so funny I started laughing, which is a problem underwater because you can't breathe underwater, so I chocked on the water and probably almost drowned because this octopus was teasing me. </b><br><br>
					
					Jeremy: Sick. You know in Hawaii, have you ever heard of ultimate frisbee? We played ultimate squid. <br><br>

					<b>Schylar: Oh my gosh, that would be weird.</b><br><br>
					
					Jeremy: When you throw the squid it's tentacles will hit you in the face. <br><br>

					<b>Schylar: Oh my gosh. </b><br><br>
					
					Jeremy: What would you say to future interns? <br><br>

					<b>Schylar: I would tell people that it's great to work with TWR and that it's just a fantastic opportunity if you have a heart for missions and for unreached people groups. One of my favorite parts of the organization is the sense of community between everybody. In Bonaire we prayed over the prayer list every single day and we would go through and pray for each individual need and it was just great to know that there were other people doing the same thing all over the world, that were praying for our needs, and for our well-being, and our safety on the towers. I love that everyone was so connected and it seems like everybody knew everybody, and everyone was so involved in the ministry. And it was just great to be a part of that. </b><br><br>
					
					Jeremy: Sick, sick. Right on. Well, thank you Schylar. <br><br>

					<b>Schylar: Thank you Jeremy. </b><br><br><br>
